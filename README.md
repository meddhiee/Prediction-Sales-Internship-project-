- **Scikit-learn**: Machine Learning models and evaluation metrics  
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting regression for time series forecasting  
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning for better accuracy  
- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model for comparison  
- **LSTM (TensorFlow/Keras)**: Neural network for sequential data  

## 📊 Workflow  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding sales trends with visualizations  
3. **Model Selection & Training**: Testing multiple ML models for best performance  
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Using MAE, MSE, and R² Score metrics  
5. **Optimization & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improving model accuracy  

## 📈 Results & Insights
